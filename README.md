# ANN-CNN-Deeplearning- Decision Tree Classification with Iris

he main objective is to apply Decision Tree Classification on two datasets: the classic Iris Flower dataset and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset, to explore classification performance, visualization, and decision tree behavior.


📌 What This Project Covers
✅ Loading and visualizing the Iris Dataset

🌳 Building and visualizing a Decision Tree Classifier

📊 Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

🔍 Comparing Gini impurity vs Entropy as splitting criteria

🧪 Bonus: Exploring the impact of max_depth on tree complexity
